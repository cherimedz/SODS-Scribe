# ðŸ“– SODScribe - Intelligent Content Extraction and Classification

**SODScribe** is an intelligent tool designed to extract and classify articles related to the SODS (School of Digital Science) department from university newsletters. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced text extraction techniques, **SODScribe** automates the process of identifying and organizing relevant content, making it easier for users to focus on articles that matter most to the department.

## Key Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:** The app can handle both regular and OCR-based PDF files, ensuring it works with scanned documents and text-based PDFs alike. It extracts text from articles, cleans up the formatting, and splits them into separate sections for classification.

- **Machine Learning Classification:** **SODScribe** uses a pre-trained machine learning model and a TF-IDF vectorizer to classify articles as SODS-related or not. Articles identified as relevant are tagged and saved for further review.

- **Downloadable Results:** After classification, the relevant SODS-related articles are saved in a text file, which can be downloaded for further analysis or sharing with the department. This feature helps in efficiently identifying and extracting the content that matters.
